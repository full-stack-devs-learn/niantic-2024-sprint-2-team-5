## Description

This project is a result of a two-day pair programming collaboration between Dureti and Hannah. The goal was to create a dynamic quiz platform using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and JavaScript. The application features an intuitive interface where users can take quizzes, navigate through questions, and receive feedback upon completion. The back-end handles quiz management, answer tracking, and scoring to provide a seamless user experience.
